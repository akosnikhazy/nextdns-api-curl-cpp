# nextdns-api-curl-cpp

This is my first ever C++ program. 

I needed a program that gets all the records from NextDNS about my devices. It returns all the visited URLs and the count of visits and puts them in a CSV file.
Provided an exe and in [get-dns-urls.cpp](https://github.com/akosnikhazy/nextdns-api-curl-cpp/blob/main/get-dns-urls.cpp) file you see in comments how to build it yourself.
